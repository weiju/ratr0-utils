Installation
============

Python 3 PIP
------------

The official and easiest way is to install through pip. Only Python 3 is supported,
so depending on whether your default Python installation is 2.x or Python 3,
the below ``pip`` invocation becomes ``pip3``:

.. highlight:: none

::

   $ pip install ratr0-utils


From source
-----------

Alternatively, it is possible to install the package from source

.. highlight:: none

::

   $ python setup.py install
