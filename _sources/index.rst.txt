Welcome to ratr0-utils
======================

ratr0_utils is a collection of utilities for converting common multimedia formats
into the data formats that are supported by the RATR0 game engine, the Spartan
programming language (both yet unreleased) and the Youtube programming series
`"Amiga Hardware Programming in C" <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF3LSwdkRB1DLYvsFJynIBnmlIXkuTwTZ>`_.

All of the above primarily target retro platforms (currently only the Commodore
Amiga is supported) and therefore typically utilizes planar graphics and 8 bit sound formats.
